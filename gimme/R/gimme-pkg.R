#' @title Group iterative multiple model estimation
#' @description This package contains functions to automatically identify the structure of group- and individual-level networks 
#' from a range of vector autoregressive models, estimated with structural equation modeling.

#' @details Researchers across varied domains gather multivariate data for each individual unit of study
#' across multiple occasions of measurement. Generally referred to as time series
#' (or in the social sciences, intensive longitudinal) data, examples include
#' psychophysiological processes such as neuroimaging and heart rate variability,
#' daily diary studies, ecological momentary assessments, data passively collected from devices such as smartphones, 
#' and observational coding of social interactions among dyads.
#' 
#' A primary goal for acquiring these data is to understand dynamic processes.
#' The gimme package contains several functions for use with these data.
#' These functions include \code{\link{gimmeSEM}}, which provides both group-
#'  and individual-level results by looking across individuals for patterns of
#'   relations among variables. A function that provides group-level results,
#'   \code{\link{aggSEM}}, is included, as well as a function that provides
#'    individual-level results, \code{\link{indSEM}}. The major functions within the gimme package all require the
#'    user to specify the data, although many additional options exist.
