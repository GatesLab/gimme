\usage{
aggSEM(data   = "",
       out    = "",
       sep    = "",
       header = ,
       ar     = TRUE,
       plot   = TRUE,
       paths  = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The path to the directory where the data files are located, 
or the name of the list containing each individual's time series. 
Each file or matrix must contain one matrix 
for each individual containing a T (time) by 
p (number of variables) matrix where the columns represent variables and
the rows represent time.}

\item{out}{The path to the directory where the results will 
be stored (optional). If specified, a copy of output files will be replaced
in directory. If directory at specified path does not
exist, it will be created.}

\item{sep}{The spacing of the data files. "" indicates space-delimited, 
"/t" indicates tab-delimited, "," indicates comma delimited. 
Only necessary to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{header}{Logical. Indicate TRUE for data files with a header. 
Only necessary to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{ar}{Logical. If TRUE, begins search for group model with 
autoregressive (AR) paths open. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, graphs depicting relations among variables 
of interest will automatically be created. For aggregate-level plot, 
red paths represent positive weights and blue paths represent negative 
weights. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{paths}{\code{lavaan}-style syntax containing paths with which to begin
model estimation. That is, Y~X indicates that Y is regressed on X, or X
predicts Y. If no header is used, then variables should be referred to
with V followed (with no separation) by the column number. If a
header is used, variables should be referred to using variable names. 
To reference lag variables, "lag" should be added to the end of the variable 
name with no separation. Defaults to NULL.}

\description{
Concatenates all individual-level data files and 
fits a group model to the data.
}
\details{
In main output directory:
 \itemize{
 \item{\strong{allBetas}} Matrix. Contains estimates for each path in the
 aggregate-level model. The row variable is the outcome and the column 
 variable is the predictor variable.
 \item{\strong{allStdErrors}} Matrix. Contains standard errors for each path 
 in the aggregate-level model. The row variable is the outcome and the column
 variable is the predictor variable.
 \item{\strong{allPathEstimates}} {Contains estimate, standard error,
 p-value, and z-value for each path for the concatenated data.}
 \item{\strong{summaryFit}} {Contains model fit information for the 
 aggregate-level model.}
 \item{\strong{summaryPathsPlot}} Contains aggregate-level plot. Red paths 
 represent positive weights and blue paths represent negative weights.
