\title{Group iterative multiple model estimation.}
\usage{
gimmeSEM(data        = "",
         out         = "",
         sep         = "",
         header      = ,
         ar          = TRUE,
         plot        = TRUE,
         subgroup    = FALSE,
         confirm_subgroup = NULL,
         paths       = NULL,
         exogenous   = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data}{The path to the directory where the data files are located,
or the name of the list containing each individual's time series. Each file
or matrix must contain one matrix for each individual containing a T (time)
by p (number of variables) matrix where the columns represent variables and
the rows represent time. Individuals must have the same variables (p)
but can have different lengths of observations (T).}

\item{out}{The path to the directory where the results will be stored
(optional). If specified,
a copy of output files will be replaced in directory. If directory at
specified path does not exist, it will be created.}

\item{sep}{The spacing of the data files. 
"" indicates space-delimited,
"/t" indicates tab-delimited, "," indicates comma delimited. Only necessary
to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{header}{Logical. Indicate TRUE for data files with a header. Only
necessary to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{ar}{Logical. If TRUE, begins search for group model with
autoregressive (AR) paths freed for estimation. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, graphs depicting relations among variables
of interest will automatically be
created. Solid lines represent contemporaneous relations (lag 0) and dashed lines reflect 
lagged relations (lag 1). For individual-level plots, red paths represent positive weights
and blue paths represent negative weights. Width of paths corresponds to estimated path weight.
For the group-level plot, black represents group-level paths, grey represents
individual-level paths, and (if subgroup = TRUE)
green represents subgroup-level paths. For the group-level plot,
the width of the edge corresponds to the count. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{subgroup}{Logical. If TRUE, subgroups are generated based on
similarities in model features using the \code{walktrap.community}
function from the \code{igraph} package. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{confirm_subgroup}{Dataframe. If subgroup is also TRUE, option to provide
subgroup labels contained in the dataframe. Dataframe has 2 columns,
the first referring to file labels, and the second an integer variable referring to subgroup label.}

\item{paths}{\code{lavaan}-style syntax containing paths with which
to begin model estimation (optional). That is, Y~X indicates that Y
is regressed on X, or X predicts Y. If no header is used,
then variables should be referred to with V followed (with no separation)
by the column number. If a
header is used, variables should be referred to using variable names.
To reference lag variables, "lag" should be added to the end of the variable
name with no separation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{exogenous}{Vector of variable names to be treated as exogenous (optional).
That is, exogenous variable X can predict Y  but cannot be predicted by Y.
If no header is used, then variables should be referred to with V followed
(with no separation) by the column number. If a header is used, variables
should be referred to using variable names.  Defaults to NULL.}

\item{groupcutoff}{Cutoff value for group- level paths. Defaults to .75,
indicating that a path must be significant across 75\% of individuals to be
included as a group-level path.}

\item{subcutoff}{Cutoff value for subgroup- level paths. Defaults to .5,
indicating that a path must be significant across at least 50\% of the
individuals in a subgroup to be considered a subgroup-level path.}

\item{diagnos}{In development. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\description{
This function identifies structural equation models for each
individual that consist of both group-level and individual-level paths.
}
\details{
In main output directory:
 \itemize{
 \item{\strong{indivPathEstimates}} {Contains estimate, standard error,
 p-value, and z-value for each path for each individual.
 If subgroup = TRUE and subgroups are found, then a column is present
 containing the subgroup membership for each individual. Also contains the
 level at which each path was estimated: group, subgroup, or individual.}
 \item{\strong{summaryFit}} {Contains model fit information for individual-
 level models. If subgroups are requested, this file also contains the
 subgroup membership for each individual.}
 \item{\strong{summaryPathCountMatrix}} Contains counts of total number of
 paths, both contemporaneous and lagged, estimated for the sample. The row
 variable is the outcome and the column variable is the predictor variable.
 \item{\strong{summaryPathCounts}} {Contains summary count information for
 paths identified at the group-, subgroup (if subgroup = TRUE), and
 individual-level.}
 \item{\strong{summaryPathsPlot}} {Produced if plot = TRUE. Contains figure
 with group, subgroup (if subgroup = TRUE), and individual-level paths
 for the sample. Black paths are group-level, green paths are subgroup-level,
 and grey paths are individual-level, where the thickness of the line
 represents the count.}
 }
 In subgroup output directory (if subgroup = TRUE):
 \itemize{
 \item{\strong{subgroup\emph{k}PathCounts}} Contains counts of relations
 among lagged and contemporaneous variables for the \strong{\emph{k}}th
 subgroup.
 \item{\strong{subgroup\emph{k}Plot}} Contains plot of group, subgroup,
 and individual level paths for the \strong{\emph{k}}th subgroup.
 Black represents group-level paths, grey represents individual-level paths,
 and green represents subgroup-level paths.
 }
 Note: if a subgroup of size n = 1 is discovered, subgroup-level output is
 not produced. \cr
 In individual output directory (where \strong{\emph{id}} represents the
 original file name for each individual):
 \itemize{
 \item{\strong{\emph{id}Betas}} Contains individual-level estimates
  of each path for each individual.
 \item{\strong{\emph{id}StdErrors}} Contains individual-level standard errors
 for each path for each individual.
 \item{\strong{\emph{id}Plot}} Contains individual-level plots. Red paths
 represent positive weights and blue paths represent negative weights.
