\arguments{
\item{data}{The path to the directory where the data files are located, 
or the name of the list containing each individual's time series. Each file 
or matrix must contain one matrix for each individual containing a 
T (time) by p (number of variables) matrix where the columns represent 
variables and the rows represent time.}

\item{out}{The path to the directory where the results will be stored 
(optional). If specified, a copy of output files will be replaced in 
directory. If directory at specified path does not exist, it will be created.}

\item{sep}{The spacing of the data files. "" indicates space-delimited, 
"/t" indicates tab-delimited, "," indicates comma delimited. Only necessary
to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{header}{Logical. Indicate TRUE for data files with a header. 
Only necessary to specify if reading data in from physical directory.}

\item{ar}{Logical. If TRUE, begins search for individual models with 
autoregressive (AR) paths open. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, graphs depicting relations among variables of 
interest will automatically be created. Defaults to TRUE. For individual-
level plots, red paths represent positive weights and blue paths represent
negative weights.}

\item{paths}{lavaan-style syntax containing paths with which to begin model
estimation. That is, Y~X indicates that Y is regressed on X, or X 
predicts Y. Paths can also be set to a specific value for estimation using \code{lavaan}-style syntax 
(e.g., 'V4 ~ 0.5*V3'), or set to 0 so that they will not be estimated 
(e.g., 'V4 ~ 0*V3'). If no header is used, then variables should be referred to with 
V followed (with no separation) by the column number. If a header is used, 
variables should be referred to using variable names. To reference lag 
variables, "lag" should be added to the end of the variable name with no 
separation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{exogenous}{Vector of variable names to be treated as exogenous.
That is, exogenous variable X can predict Y  but cannot be predicted by Y.  
If no header is used, then variables should be referred to with V followed 
(with no separation) by the column number. If a header is used, variables 
should be referred to using variable names.  Defaults to NULL.}

\item{outcome}{Vector of variable names to be treated as outcome (optional). This is a variable
that can be predicted by others but cannot predict. If no header is used, then variables should be referred to with V followed
(with no separation) by the column number.  If a header is used, variables should be referred 
to using variable names.}

\item{conv_vars}{Vector of variable names to be convolved via smoothed Finite Impulse 
Response (sFIR). Defaults to NULL.}

\item{conv_length}{Expected response length in seconds. For functional MRI BOLD, 16 seconds (default) is typical
for the hemodynamic response function.}

\item{conv_interval}{Interval between data acquisition. Currently conv_length/conv_interval must be a constant. For 
fMRI studies, this is the repetition time. Defaults to 1.}

\item{mult_vars}{Vector of variable names to be multiplied to explore bilinear/modulatory
effects (optional). All multiplied variables will be treated as exogenous (X can predict
Y but cannot be predicted by Y). Within the vector, multiplication of two variables should be
indicated with an asterik (e.g. V1*V2). If no header is used, variables should be referred to with 
V followed by the column number (with no separation). If a header is used, each variable should be
referred to using variable names. If multiplication with the lag 1 of a variable is desired, the 
variable name should be followed by "lag" with no separation (e.g. V1*V2lag). Note that if
multiplied variables are desired, at least one variable in the dataset must be specified as exogenous.
Defaults to NULL.}

\item{mean_center_mult}{Logical. If TRUE, the variables indicated in mult_vars will be mean-centered
before being multiplied together. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{standardize}{Logical. If TRUE, all variables will be standardized to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{hybrid}{Logical. If TRUE, enables hybrid-VAR models where both directed contemporaneous paths and contemporaneous
covariances among residuals are candidate relations in the search space. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{VAR}{Logical.  If true, VAR models where contemporaneous covariances among residuals are candidate relations in the 
search space.  Defaults to FALSE.}

\description{
This function identifies structural equation models for each
individual. It does not utilize any shared information from the sample.
}
\details{
Output is a list of results if saved as an object and/or files printed to a directory if the "out" argument is used.
